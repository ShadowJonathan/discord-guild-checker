Hello, welcome to the discord status and guild checker tool!
This is a custom version of my own bot, named blue Belt, it's open source, and it's on github.
After you've followed the download instructions, run the "install.bat" tool, it'll follow and execute the steps automatically to get your tool running.

If you want to do it yourself, or dont trust the batch file, thats okay too, just follow the instructions after the "run install.bat" step.

1. Go to https://golang.org/dl/, on any preferred browser, and download the latest build of GO
2. Install GO, this'll take a moment.
3. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads, download and install the latest version of git, this is neccecary for discordgo to be installed.
4. Set GOPATH to a folder in your hard drive in your computer's environmental tables, if you dont know how to do this, go to https://golang.org/doc/install#windows_env
5. After this, the "install.bat" file can be executed without any errors.

The install.bat file will install the discordgo package, which is needed to compile the tool for your computer, it'll run the compile tool after this, and automatically tries to run the program for windows and OSX.

You need a token file for the tool to work, it can be get from any bot account, but also any user account, when the tool is ran without any token in the token file, it'll create a empty one, where a token can be deposited into.

To get your token, you can either get it from the bot page on the development tab in discord, but for a normal user, a more "cheaty way" is required.

In chrome, or on the application, open the developer console with "ctrl + shift + i", it'll open up the console which immidiatly warns you to not copy paste anything into it.
You dont need to do that, getting your user token isnt possible anymore through that, navigate to the "application" tab, and expand storage, you'll see "http://discordapp.com", click that, and select the "token" value, copy that, paste it in the token file, remove the quotation marks, and save the file.

If you want a more detailed explaination, or are scared that your data or privacy will be stolen, ask a programmer who knows go about the validality of the source files, or ask me for a likewise detailed explaination.
